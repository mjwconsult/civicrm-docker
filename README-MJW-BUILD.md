# Custom docker-standalong build

Currently using https://res.mjw.pt/dl/mjwcivicrm-6.3.1-standalone-6.3-std.tar.gz
which is generated by our standard build process.

## "Generic" build:

docker build build/civicrm --build-arg CIVICRM_VERSION=6.3.1 --build-arg PHP_VERSION=8.3 -t mjw-civicrm-6.3.1

## Our build:

Use https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-docker/pull/35 which means we have to rebuild common-base, civicrm-base and civicrm!

So actually using "mjw" branch here: https://github.com/mjwconsult/civicrm-docker/tree/mjw

```
docker build build/common-base -t mjw-common-base
docker build build/civicrm-base -t mjw-civicrm-base
```

For Standalone:

```
docker build --build-arg CIVICRM_DOWNLOAD_URL="https://res.mjw.pt/dl/mjwcivicrm-6.6.3-standalone-6.6-std.tar.gz" --build-arg PHP_VERSION=8.3 build/civicrm -t mjw-civicrm-6.6.3-mjw
```

For WordPress:

```
docker build --build-arg CIVICRM_DOWNLOAD_URL="https://res.mjw.pt/dl/mjwcivicrm-6.6.3-wordpress-6.6-std.zip" --build-arg PHP_VERSION=8.3 build/civicrm-wordpress -t mjw-civicrm-wordpress-6.6.3-mjw
```
